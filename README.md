# Computer-Science-I-Project

## Basic description:
This project was assigned in my CSC141 class at Rochester Institute of Technology in Autumn 2019. The goal of the project was to create an application capable of creating a simple website in two modes: website and wizard mode. Website mode creates an HTML file based on specifications from a text file with specific markers(for instance, !title points to a title and the program converts this into HTML tags). With wizard mode, a user is prompted to enter specifications for the website on the console.
